                The Asian citrus psyllid, <i>Diaphorina citri</i> Kuwayama (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=121845" target="_blank">Hemiptera: Psyllidae</a>) is a vector for the causative agent of Huanglongbing(HLB) or citrus greening, which threatens citrus production worldwide. The Asian citrus psyllid originated in Asia but it is now also found in parts of the Middle East, South and Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean. In the United States, this psyllid was first detected in Florida in 1998 and is now also found in Louisiana, Georgia, Arizona, South Carolina and Texas. The psyllid feeds on all varieties of citrus (e.g., oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and mandarins).

<h4><i>De novo</i> transcriptome</h4>
The <i>D. citri</i> <i>de novo</i> transcriptome combines transcript evidence from Iso-Seq data as well as  short read RNA-Seq data. The transcriptome was released on <b>December 10, 2019</b> and described in a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/869685v1" target="_blank">preprint publication</a>. Slides describing the <i>de novo</i> transcriptome are available <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/suryasaha/saha-uc-davis-plant-pathology-seminar-infrastructure-for-battling-the-citrus-greening-hlb-disease-high-quality-genomes-and-an-open-access-integrated-systems-biology-portal">online</a>.
<br>
<i>De novo</i> transcriptome has 60,261 transcripts with a N50 of 3.6Kbp for 40,637 genes. An identifier was chosen according to the source raw data: DcDT for RNA-Seq transcripts and DcDi for Iso-Seq transcripts. The dataset was filtered using Pfam domains and TransDecoder to retain transcripts with coding regions. The assembly is available in our <a href="/tools/blast?db_id=36">Blast databases</a>.
<br>

<h4>MCOT transcriptome 1.1</h4>
The <i>D. citri</i> MCOT v1.0 transcriptome is a genome independent transcriptome assembly that provides a comprehensive set of gene models and was performed with the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965174815000144">MCOT pipeline</a> where transcripts from <a href="http://www.yandell-lab.org/software/maker.html">Maker</a>, <a href="http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/">Cufflinks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki">Trinity</a> and <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oases/">Oases</a> pipelines are combined. The <a href="http://entoplp.okstate.edu/profiles/jiang.htm">Jiang lab</a> has kindly provided the MCOT annotations. MCOT v1.1 set has 30,562 CDS, transcripts and proteins. Combining gene models from Maker and cufflinks that are based on the genome with transcripts from <i>denovo</i> transcriptome assembly from Trinity and Oases allows the identification of genes which only have transcript evidence from RNAseq.
<br>
MCOT v1.1 has been annotated with <a href="https://github.com/groupschoof/AHRD" target="_blank">AHRD</a> and <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/interproscan.html" target="_blank">Interproscan</a>. The description includes Pfam domains, GO terms and a description generated using Uniprot, Interproscan and the AHRD pipeline. The <a href="ftp://ftp.citrusgreening.org/annotation/MCOT/README" target="_blank">mapping file</a> describes the connection between the original NCBI annotations and the OGSv1.0, MCOT, and <i>Drosophila</i> orthologs. Please see the <a href="ftp://ftp.citrusgreening.org/annotation/MCOT/README" target="_blank">README</a> for more information.

<h4>Diaci transcriptome 0.9</h4>
Diaci_transcriptome_0.9, a transcriptome assembly was constructed by Nan Leng of Illumina using <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/">Velvet</a> and <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oasis/">Oasis</a>. This <i>de novo</i> transcriptome assembly was produced using as input RNA reads from adult, egg and nymph tissue. Separate transcriptome assemblies for adult, egg and nymph tissues were also constructed by Nan Leng using <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/">Velvet</a> and <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oasis/">Oasis</a> using only RNA reads from adult, egg and nymph tissues respectively. This transcriptome assembly was used in the Maker annotation of Diaci1.1 genome build.
